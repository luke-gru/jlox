TODO:
* multiple var declaration [DONE], multiple assignment [], return multiple values [DONE]
* splat parameters + splat arguments [DONE]
* object literals, maybe? []
* iterators, with returning iterator with instance iter() method like python,
along with 'for elem in obj' syntax [DONE]
* private methods, maybe? []
* all classes inherit from Object automatically [DONE]
* ["propName"] and ["propName"]= for dynamic property get and set [DONE]
* add builtin Array class instead of using LoxArray, use LoxInstance with
class of Array [DONE]
* add builtin String class instead of using java StringBuffer, use LoxInstance with
class of String [DONE]
* Add way to cast strings to numbers [DONE]
* Add string interpolation, maybe? []
* add standard Error classes [DONE]
* throw Interrupt errors on interrupts, so the program can catch them when
the interpreter is running. []
* signal handling []
* add keyword arguments []
* default arguments for functions [DONE]
* allow overridden methods with different number of arguments, maybe? []
* frozen objects, can't use setProperty on the instance [DONE]
* Don't allow frozen objects to use push() and other methods that change the
object's internals. []
* better stdlib []
* add test suite [DONE]
* add '+=, -=,' etc binary operators [DONE]
* class (static) methods and properties [DONE]
* add Object#dup method, which shallow copies an object and its properties [DONE]
* add Object#initDup hook for duplicated objects [DONE]
* Figure out what it means to dup a class. Should this be possible? It is in
Ruby, for example. []
* Add builtin class Class, like Ruby. Class constructor creates new anon class. [DONE]
* Allow re-opening classes [DONE]
* Allow undefining methods and functions []
* Allow aliasing methods like Ruby, which creates a copy of the original
method? [DONE]
* Fix alias() functions to actually clone() the callable for stack trace
purposes. []
* Add singleton classes. If so, would have to re-implement static functions [DONE]
* Add `in(expr) { }` construct like JavaScript's with or Ruby's instance_eval [DONE].
* Add eval(String) for evaling code. [DONE]
* Add way to load other script files [DONE]
* Add way to nest classes within classes and refer to nested classes by scoped
names. [DONE]
* Allow arbitrary expressions and statements within class { } and in { }
blocks which get evaluated once upon being visited. [DONE]
* Fix \" within double-quoted strings [DONE]
* Allow single-quoted strings [DONE]
* Add Object#_singletonClass [DONE] (but need to fix
obj._singletonClass._singletonClass, returns wrong value)
* Add more classes to stdlib []
* Make functions LoxInstances, instead of treating them differently. []
* implement some sort of methodMissing hook, like Ruby's. []
* allow objects to overload methods for primitive operations: +, -, *, [],
[]=, maybe also '.' (propGet) and '.=', propSet. []
* Make '::' lookup, also maybe nested classes get set on the enclosing class
as a property, so lookup is performed with '.'? [DONE]
* property lookup should look first for properties, then getters, then methods.
Right now if we have a getter then set that same property, when we retrieve
the property the getter is called. [DONE]
* getter/setter/ method lookup should respect singleton class lookup like
Ruby's. Right now it acts weirdly for static functions. [DONE]
* Add c style multiline comments [DONE]
* make REPL better by adding readline support (up key, down key, history
support, etc.) []
* Add Class#methodNames(bool), Class#getterNames(bool) and
Class#setterNames(bool) methods []
* Add Class#ancestors method, returns array of Class objects []
* Add Hash or Map class? []
* Add Object#propertyNames(bool includeGetters = true), and Object#properties returns Hash of property names
and values []
* Add isCallable(obj) global function [DONE]
* Add static (frozen, interned) strings, like Ruby [], s"" or s'', can't have
interpolation []
